## 2026-03-21 — GlassWorm extensionPack Transitive Attack, npm Dependency Chain Postinstall, TeamPCP Actions Credential Stealer

**Sources:**
- [Eclipse Foundation — GlassWorm Wave 7: extensionPack Transitive Dependency Attack](https://blogs.eclipse.org/post/mikael-barbero/glassworm-wave-7-extensionpack-transitive-dependency-attack)
- [StepSecurity — Malicious npm Releases Found in Popular React Native Packages](https://www.stepsecurity.io/blog/malicious-npm-releases-found-in-popular-react-native-packages---130k-monthly-downloads-compromised)
- [StepSecurity — Trivy Compromised a Second Time: Malicious v0.69.4 Release](https://www.stepsecurity.io/blog/trivy-compromised-a-second-time---malicious-v0-69-4-release)

**Event Summary:** Three new detection rules, IOC updates, and vulnerability enrichment were added. The Eclipse Foundation documented GlassWorm Wave 7, where malicious Open VSX extensions use `extensionPack` and `extensionDependencies` arrays to silently install payload extensions as transitive dependencies, bypassing marketplace review. StepSecurity reported a three-layer npm dependency chain attack (GlassWorm/ForceMemo) that compromised popular React Native packages with 130K+ monthly downloads, using hollow relay scoped packages to deliver Solana blockchain C2 malware via postinstall hooks executing standalone JavaScript loader files. StepSecurity also documented a second compromise of the Trivy GitHub Action (v0.69.4) by the TeamPCP threat actor, which injected a comprehensive credential stealer that harvests Runner.Worker process memory, collects developer credentials, encrypts data with RSA-4096, and exfiltrates to the typosquatted domain `scan.aquasecurtiy.org`.

**New Patterns Added:**

### SUP-011: Open VSX extensionPack/extensionDependencies transitive dependency attack
- **Category:** supply_chain
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.87
- **Pattern:** Detects `extensionPack` and `extensionDependencies` arrays containing suspicious extension IDs following the GlassWorm naming pattern, including AI-themed names like `claude-code-extension`, `antigravity-cockpit`, and `sql-turbo-tool`.
- **Justification:** Direct detection of the GlassWorm Wave 7 transitive dependency attack documented by the Eclipse Foundation. The technique abuses VS Code extension dependency resolution to silently install malicious extensions.

### SUP-012: npm dependency chain attack via hollow relay package with postinstall loader
- **Category:** supply_chain
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.85
- **Pattern:** Detects `postinstall` scripts executing standalone JavaScript loader files (`node child.js`, `node init.js`, `node setup.js`, `node loader.js`) characteristic of the GlassWorm/ForceMemo three-layer dependency chain attack.
- **Justification:** Detection of the npm dependency chain attack documented by StepSecurity, where compromised packages use hollow relay scoped packages to deliver Solana C2 malware via postinstall hooks.

### MAL-039: GitHub Actions credential stealer with Runner.Worker memory harvesting (TeamPCP)
- **Category:** malware_pattern
- **Severity:** critical
- **Confidence:** 0.92

**Event Summary:** Two new detection rules, two IOC domains, and one new CVE were added. Jamf Threat Labs published a detailed analysis of the GhostClaw/GhostLoader campaign, where malicious SKILL.md files in GitHub repositories deliver macOS infostealers via OpenClaw AI-assisted workflows. The attack uses the fake "OpenClawProvider" dependency to execute a base64-encoded curl-to-bash payload from IP 91.92.242.30, with persistence via `~/.cache/.npm_telemetry/monitor.js` and C2 communication through `trackpipe.dev`. A dev.to security advisory confirmed five malicious skills from the `openclaw/skills` repository (auto-updater, gog, excel, nano-pdf, youtube-watcher) affecting approximately 1,016 downloads. BlackFog documented the LotAI (Living off the AI) technique, where malware uses hidden WebView2 sessions to route C2 traffic through trusted AI assistant domains like Copilot and Grok, encoding reconnaissance data in URL query parameters and extracting commands from AI responses. CVE-2026-33060 was disclosed as an SSRF vulnerability in the @aborruso/ckan-mcp-server npm package (< 0.4.85) via the `base_url` parameter in `ckan_package_search` and `sparql_query` tools.

**New Patterns Added:**

### MAL-037: GhostClaw/GhostLoader SKILL.md malware delivery via OpenClaw workflows
- **Category:** malware_pattern
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.88
- **Pattern:** Detects `OpenClawProvider` dependency references, `GHOST_PASSWORD_ONLY` environment variable, `NODE_CHANNEL` set to `anglmf` or `cryptoexth4`, `trackpipe.dev` C2 domain, persistence paths (`~/.cache/.npm_telemetry/monitor.js`, `/tmp/sys-opt-*.js`), `install.app-distribution.net` Windows payload domain, `curl -k` to known malicious IPs, and `dscl . -authonly` credential validation.
- **Justification:** Direct detection of the GhostClaw campaign documented by Jamf Threat Labs. The malware targets OpenClaw AI-assisted workflows by embedding malicious setup instructions in SKILL.md files.

### MAL-038: LotAI — AI assistant used as covert C2 relay via hidden WebView2
- **Category:** malware_pattern
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.83
- **Pattern:** Detects `WebView2` combined with AI assistant references (`copilot`, `grok`, `hidden session`), `LotAI`, `Living off the AI`, and `ai assistant` combined with C2/exfiltration keywords.
- **Justification:** Detection of the LotAI technique documented by BlackFog, where malware abuses AI assistants with URL-fetching capabilities as command-and-control relays to bypass network security controls.

**IOC Updates:**
- Added domain: `trackpipe.dev` (GhostClaw C2 callback domain)
- Added domain: `install.app-distribution.net` (GhostClaw Windows payload distribution)

**Vulnerability Updates:**
- Added CVE-2026-33060 (medium SSRF, @aborruso/ckan-mcp-server < 0.4.85) to vuln_db.json

- [VentureBeat — Meta's rogue AI agent passed every identity check](https://venturebeat.com/security/meta-rogue-ai-agent-confused-deputy-iam-identity-governance-matrix)

**Event Summary:** Three new detection rules and vulnerability enrichment were added. Unit 42 published analysis of two malware samples leveraging LLM APIs for remote C2 decision-making: a .NET infostealer using OpenAI GPT-3.5-Turbo for evasion technique generation, environment analysis, and obfuscated communication, and a Golang dropper for Sliver malware that uses an LLM to assess target environments before proceeding with infection. Sonatype discovered two malicious npm packages (`sbx-mask` and `touch-adv`) published from a compromised maintainer account that exfiltrate environment variables via postinstall scripts to webhook.site and agentmail endpoints. Vectra AI documented the "prompt control" persistence technique where attackers embed instructions in heartbeat files and memory stores that AI agents periodically read, creating a cognitive control plane for persistent C2 without traditional network beaconing. VentureBeat reported CVE-2026-27826 (SSRF) and CVE-2026-27825 (arbitrary file write) in mcp-atlassian versions before 0.17.0, enabling unauthenticated RCE from the local network.

**New Patterns Added:**

### MAL-036: AI-gated malware execution via LLM API C2 decision-making
- **Category:** malware_pattern
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.85
- **Pattern:** Detects `GenerateEvasionTechnique`, `AnalyzeTargetEnvironment`, `GenerateObfuscatedCommunication`, `SendToC2ServerWithLLM` method names, `ai-powered stealth`, `llm-enhanced`, `X-LLM-Enhanced` headers, and `gpt-3.5-turbo` combined with evasion/obfuscation/exfiltration/C2/beacon keywords.
- **Justification:** Direct detection of AI-assisted malware documented by Unit 42. The malware uses OpenAI API calls for remote decision-making in C2 operations.

### SUP-010: npm postinstall environment variable exfiltration via webhook or agentmail
- **Category:** malware_pattern
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.87
- **Pattern:** Detects `process.env` combined with `webhook.site`, `agentmail`, or `curl` on the same line, and `postinstall` scripts combined with environment variable access and exfiltration endpoints.
- **Justification:** Direct detection of the sbx-mask/touch-adv npm supply chain attack reported by Sonatype on March 19, 2026.

### PINJ-003: Prompt control persistence via heartbeat file or memory store manipulation
- **Category:** instruction_abuse
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.84
- **Pattern:** Detects `heartbeat file` combined with instruction/command/execute keywords, memory/context store combined with inject/poison/manipulate/persist keywords, and `cognitive control plane` references.
- **Justification:** Detection of the prompt control persistence technique documented by Vectra AI, where agent context is weaponized as a C2 channel.

**IOC Updates:**
- Added `webhook.site` to domain IOC list (exfiltration endpoint for sbx-mask campaign)
- Fixed duplicate entries and missing commas in ioc_db.json

**Vulnerability Updates:**
- Added CVE-2026-27826 (critical SSRF, mcp-atlassian < 0.17.0) to vuln_db.json

- [VPNCentral — ForceMemo Attacks GitHub Accounts and Quietly Backdoors Python Repositories](https://vpncentral.com/forcememo-attacks-github-accounts-and-quietly-backdoors-python-repositories-with-force-pushed-malware/)

**Event Summary:** Two new detection rules and significant IOC/vulnerability enrichment were added. Aikido Security published a full analysis of the GlassWorm Chrome extension RAT, revealing a multi-stage attack that force-installs a malicious Chrome extension masquerading as Google Docs Offline (version 1.95.1). The extension functions as a full RAT with commands including `startkeylogger`, `domsnapshot`, `localstoragedump`, and `capture_clipboard`, using Solana blockchain memos as a C2 dead-drop channel. C2 infrastructure operates at 45.32.150.251, 217.69.3.152, 217.69.0.159, and 45.150.34.158. Socket.dev reported that GlassWorm sleeper extensions on Open VSX have shifted to delivering payloads from GitHub-hosted VSIX files, moving outside the Eclipse Foundation's takedown reach. ProArch detailed the CVE-2026-25253 OpenClaw one-click RCE attack chain, where a malicious `gatewayUrl` parameter steals auth tokens via WebSocket and then disables execution approval prompts (`exec.approvals.set: off`) for full remote code execution. Zscaler ThreatLabz disclosed SnappyClient, a new C2 framework implant delivered via HijackLoader targeting cryptocurrency wallets, with C2 at 151.242.122.227 and 179.43.167.210. SC Media reported critical vulnerabilities in LangSmith (CVE-2026-25750, account takeover) and SGLang (CVE-2026-3060, CVE-2026-3059, CVE-2026-3989, unpatched RCE). VPNCentral covered the ForceMemo campaign linking GlassWorm credential theft to force-pushed Python repository backdoors using Solana blockchain memos for C2.

**New Patterns Added:**

### MAL-034: GlassWorm Chrome extension force-install RAT
- **Category:** malware_pattern
- **Severity:** critical
- **Confidence:** 0.90
- **Pattern:** Detects `--install-extension --force` extension sideloading, Google Docs Offline 1.95 masquerade, `jucku/manifest.json` extension directory, `chrome.storage.local` agent_id persistence, `/api/register`, `/api/commands?agent_id`, `/api/exfil`, `/api/webhook/auth-detected` C2 endpoints, and RAT commands (`startkeylogger`, `getkeyloggerdata`, `domsnapshot`, `localstoragedump`, `capture_clipboard`).
- **Justification:** Direct detection of the GlassWorm Chrome extension RAT documented by Aikido Security. The malware deploys a persistent browser-based RAT with keylogging, cookie theft, session surveillance (targeting Bybit), and screenshot capabilities, using Solana wallet memos as a C2 dead-drop.

### MAL-035: OpenClaw gatewayUrl parameter injection and approval bypass
- **Category:** malware_pattern
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.87
- **Pattern:** Detects `gatewayUrl` parameter injection, `exec.approvals.set` / `exec.approval.set` disabling patterns, `approvals.disable` / `approvals.bypass` / `approvals.override` calls, and `confirmation_prompts` disabling.
- **Justification:** Direct detection of the CVE-2026-25253 attack chain. The OpenClaw Control UI blindly trusts the `gatewayUrl` URL parameter, leaking auth tokens to attacker-controlled servers. Combined with approval bypass, this enables full one-click RCE on 40,000+ exposed instances.

**IOC Updates:**
- Added IP: `151.242.122.227` (SnappyClient C2 control session)
- Added IP: `179.43.167.210` (SnappyClient C2 control session)
- Added IP: `217.69.3.152` (GlassWorm Stage 2/3 exfiltration server)
- Added IP: `217.69.0.159` (GlassWorm DHT bootstrap node)
- Added IP: `45.150.34.158` (GlassWorm Ledger/Trezor seed phrase exfiltration)
- Added domain: `webhook.site` (ClawHavoc data exfiltration endpoint)

**Vulnerability Updates:**
- Added CVE-2026-25750 for `langsmith` Python package (account takeover, fixed in 0.12.71)
- Added CVE-2026-3060 for `sglang` Python package (unauthenticated RCE, unpatched)

## 2026-03-19 — SnappyClient C2 Implant, Click-Fix WebDAV Variant

**Sources:**
- [The Hacker News — Investigating New Click-Fix Variant with WebDAV](https://thehackernews.com/2026/03/investigating-new-click-fix-variant.html)
- [Dark Reading — New C2 Implant SnappyClient Targets Crypto Wallets](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/new-c2-implant-snappyclient-targets-crypto-wallets)

**Event Summary:** Two related malware campaigns were identified. A new Click-Fix variant uses `net use` to map attacker-controlled WebDAV shares and execute malicious batch scripts, bypassing browser download protections and SmartScreen checks. The trojanized WorkFlowy desktop application (Electron-based) hides a C2 beacon inside the `app.asar` archive. Separately, the SnappyClient C2 implant (C++ based, delivered via HijackLoader) targets cryptocurrency wallets using ChaCha20-Poly1305 encrypted communications. Both campaigns share infrastructure at `cloudflare.report` and `happyglamper.ro`.

**New Patterns Added:**

### MAL-034: Click-Fix WebDAV share mount and execute pattern
- **Category:** malware_pattern
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.88
- **Pattern:** Detects `net use` commands mapping WebDAV shares (`DavWWWRoot`, `\webdav`) followed by execution of batch/command/executable files.
- **Justification:** Captures a new Click-Fix delivery variant that stages payloads on attacker-controlled WebDAV servers. Unlike browser-based downloads, WebDAV-mounted files bypass SmartScreen and download protection checks, making this a high-signal evasion technique.
- **Mitigation:** Do not map WebDAV shares via `net use` and execute remote scripts. Block WebDAV mount commands in skill files and treat any `net use` + execute chain as suspicious.

### MAL-035: Trojanized Electron app.asar C2 payload injection
- **Category:** malware_pattern
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.86
- **Pattern:** Detects `app.asar` references combined with execution primitives (`exec`, `spawn`, `fetch`, `request`, `net.request`) indicating a trojanized Electron application with injected C2 functionality.
- **Justification:** Captures the SnappyClient/Click-Fix campaign technique of hiding C2 beacons inside Electron `app.asar` archives. Legitimate Electron apps do not typically combine asar manipulation with direct execution or network calls in the same context.
- **Mitigation:** Verify the integrity of Electron application packages and reject modified asar files that contain unexpected network or execution calls.

**IOC Updates:**
- Added domain: `cloudflare.report` (SnappyClient/Click-Fix C2)
- Added IP: `94.156.170.255` (SnappyClient C2)
- Added IP: `144.31.165.173` (Click-Fix WebDAV staging)
- Added URL: `https://cloudflare.report/forever/e/` (SnappyClient payload endpoint)

**Version:** Rules updated from 2026.03.18.2 to 2026.03.19.1
**Testing:** Added coverage in `tests/test_rules.py::test_new_patterns_2026_03_19` and `tests/test_showcase_examples.py` with showcase fixtures `examples/showcase/89_clickfix_webdav_share_exec` and `examples/showcase/90_electron_asar_c2_injection`.

**Event Summary:** Two new threat categories were identified. Aikido Security disclosed the BlokTrooper compromise of the `fast-draft` Open VSX extension (26,000+ downloads), where malicious versions (0.10.89, 0.10.105, 0.10.106, 0.10.112) fetch a GitHub-hosted payload from `BlokTrooper/extension` and pipe it into a shell, deploying a four-module attack framework: a Socket.IO RAT with full desktop control, a browser and crypto wallet stealer targeting 25+ wallet extensions, a recursive file exfiltration module, and a clipboard surveillance module. The C2 infrastructure operates at 195.201.104.53 on ports 6931, 6936, and 6939. Separately, ClawSecure reported the ClawHavoc campaign affecting 539 OpenClaw skills (18.7% of the most popular), which harvests agent memory and identity files (`MEMORY.md`, `SOUL.md`) for impersonation and lateral movement, with C2 callbacks to 91.92.242.30 and exfiltration via glot.io/api/ and webhook.site. CVE-2026-25253 was assigned for the related OpenClaw RCE vulnerability.

**New Patterns Added:**

### MAL-033: BlokTrooper VSX extension GitHub-hosted downloader pattern
- **Category:** malware_pattern
- **Severity:** critical
- **Confidence:** 0.91
- **Pattern:** Detects `raw.githubusercontent.com/BlokTrooper` payload host, `fd.onlyOncePlease` one-time guard variable, `/cldbs` + `/upload` exfiltration routes, and `/api/service/makelog` clipboard logging endpoint.
- **Justification:** Direct detection of the BlokTrooper attack chain documented by Aikido Security. The compromised `fast-draft` extension alternates between clean and malicious versions, indicating a stolen publisher token. The four-module payload (RAT, stealer, file exfil, clipboard monitor) represents a full compromise toolkit.

### EXF-017: OpenClaw agent memory and identity file harvesting
- **Category:** exfiltration
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.88
- **Pattern:** Detects access to `MEMORY.md`, `SOUL.md`, `.openclaw/memory`, `.openclaw/soul`, `.openclaw/identity`, and `agent-identity` or `agent-memory` files.
- **Justification:** Direct detection of the ClawHavoc campaign's agent file harvesting technique. Agent memory and identity files contain sensitive context, personality data, and conversation history that can be weaponized for impersonation, social engineering, or lateral movement across agent networks.

**IOC Updates:**
- Added IP: `195.201.104.53` (BlokTrooper C2)
- Added domain: `pastefy.app` (DRILLAPP C2 staging)

**Vulnerability Updates:**
- Added CVE-2026-25253 for `openclaw` npm package (RCE via malicious webpage, CVSS 8.8)

**Corpus Updates:**
- Added `corpus/malicious/a29_bloktrooper_vsx.md`
- Added `corpus/malicious/a30_clawhavoc_memory.md`

- [SynScan — OpenClaw MEDIA: Directive Injection](https://synscan.net/vuln/openclaw-vulnerable-to-local-file-exfiltration-via-mcp-tool-result-media-directive-injection)

**Event Summary:** Four new threat categories were identified. Proofpoint disclosed the CursorJack attack path, where malicious `cursor://` deeplinks trick developers into installing rogue MCP servers that execute arbitrary commands. The LeakNet ransomware gang adopted a "bring your own runtime" (BYOR) technique using the legitimate Deno binary to decode and execute base64 JavaScript payloads from `data:` URLs, minimizing forensic artifacts. GlassWorm Wave 6 expanded to 433 compromised components across GitHub, npm, and VSCode/OpenVSX, with the `lzcdrtfxyqiplpd` marker variable and `~/init.json` persistence file as key indicators. A `MEDIA:` directive injection vulnerability in OpenClaw allows malicious MCP tool servers to exfiltrate local files through the media processing pipeline. Additionally, the `bittensor-wallet` 4.0.2 PyPI package was found backdoored with a 3-layer C2 exfiltration system.

**New Patterns Added:**

### MAL-030: IDE deeplink MCP server install abuse
- **Category:** malware_pattern
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.88
- **Pattern:** Detects `cursor://`, `vscode://`, or `vscode-insiders://` deeplinks containing MCP server install parameters.
- **Justification:** Direct detection of the CursorJack attack path documented by Proofpoint. Malicious deeplinks embed harmful server configurations that execute commands upon user approval.

### MAL-031: Deno bring-your-own-runtime execution pattern
- **Category:** malware_pattern
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.87
- **Pattern:** Detects Deno executing remote URLs, `data:` URI payloads, or `eval` with string arguments.
- **Justification:** Direct detection of the LeakNet BYOR technique. The legitimate Deno runtime is abused to execute malicious JavaScript in memory, bypassing binary blocklists.

### MAL-032: GlassWorm persistence marker variable
- **Category:** malware_pattern
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.85
- **Pattern:** Detects the `lzcdrtfxyqiplpd` marker variable, `~/init.json` persistence config, or `~/node-v22` bundled runtime.
- **Justification:** Direct detection of GlassWorm Wave 6 persistence indicators. StepSecurity recommends searching for this marker variable as the primary indicator of compromise.

### PINJ-002: MCP tool result MEDIA directive injection
- **Category:** instruction_abuse
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.86
- **Pattern:** Detects `MEDIA:` directives followed by absolute file paths, `file://` URIs, or Windows drive paths in tool result content.
- **Justification:** Direct detection of the OpenClaw file exfiltration vulnerability (GHSA-jjgj-cpp9-cvpv). Malicious MCP tool servers inject `MEDIA:` directives to exfiltrate local files.

**IOC Updates:**
- **Domains added:** `finney.opentensor-metrics.com`, `finney.metagraph-stats.com`, `finney.subtensor-telemetry.com`, `opentensor-cdn.com`, `t.opentensor-cdn.com` (bittensor-wallet C2), `serialmenot.com`, `crahdhduf.com`, `weaplink.com` (LeakNet C2)
- **IPs added:** `144.31.224.98` (LeakNet C2)

## 2026-03-17 — v0.3.1: Skill Graph Analysis, ML Pipeline, and Distribution Channels

**Summary:** v0.3.1 ships three new structural detection rules (`PINJ-GRAPH-001/002/003`) for skill graph analysis, ML-based prompt injection detection via a DeBERTa-v3-base LoRA adapter (ONNX INT8, 111-example corpus), `skillscan model` and `skillscan rule` command groups, a reusable GitHub Actions workflow, pre-commit hook, and VS Code extension scaffold. The signature-as-data architecture is now fully operational: rules, IOCs, and the ONNX model are versioned data artifacts updated independently of the scanner binary.

**New Rules:**
- `PINJ-GRAPH-001` — Skill loads a remote `.md` file at runtime (dead-drop instruction injection, HIGH)
- `PINJ-GRAPH-002` — Skill grants `Bash`/`Computer`/`Shell` tool without a declared purpose section (MEDIUM)
- `PINJ-GRAPH-003` — Skill instructs agent to write memory files (`SOUL.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.claude/settings.json`) (CRITICAL)

**ML Model:** `kurtpayne/skillscan-deberta-adapter` on HuggingFace — DeBERTa-v3-base LoRA, ONNX INT8, trained on 111 labeled examples (54 benign / 57 injection). Enable with `skillscan scan --ml-detect` after `skillscan model sync`.

**Version:** Rules updated from 2026.03.17.2 to 2026.03.17.3

- [NVD — CVE-2026-4270](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-4270)

**Event Summary:** The GlassWorm campaign expanded into the MCP ecosystem (Wave 5, reported 2026-03-16). Typosquatted npm packages such as `@iflow-mcp/watercrawl-watercrawl-mcp` and backdoored React Native packages (`react-native-country-select@0.3.91`, `react-native-international-phone-number@0.11.8`) use a novel Solana blockchain RPC dead-drop technique: the malware calls `getSignaturesForAddress` to read on-chain transaction memos containing encoded C2 URLs, then fetches and executes the decoded payload. Separately, a DPRK-linked campaign delivers PylangGhost RAT via npm packages (`react-refresh-update`, `@jaime9008/math-service`) with C2 at `173.211.46.22:8080` and staging domain `malicanbur.pro`. Additionally, CVE-2026-4270 was published for `@awslabs/aws-api-mcp-server` (path traversal, CVSS 6.8, fixed in 1.3.9).

**New Patterns Added:**

### MAL-029: Solana RPC blockchain C2 resolution marker
- **Category:** malware_pattern
- **Severity:** critical
- **Confidence:** 0.90
- **Pattern:** Detects `getSignaturesForAddress` / `getConfirmedSignaturesForAddress2` Solana RPC calls combined with `memo`/`logMessages` field access and subsequent execution sinks (`eval`, `exec`, `spawn`, `fetch`, etc.), or `@solana/web3` imports combined with the same RPC+memo pattern.
- **Justification:** Direct detection of the blockchain-based C2 dead-drop technique documented in GlassWorm Wave 5. The attacker stores encoded C2 URLs in Solana transaction memos and resolves them at install time, making the C2 infrastructure immutable and censorship-resistant.

**IOC Updates:**
- **IPs added:** `45.32.150.251`, `45.32.151.157`, `70.34.242.255` (GlassWorm staging servers), `173.211.46.22` (PylangGhost C2)
- **Domains added:** `malicanbur.pro` (PylangGhost staging domain)

**Vulnerability DB Updates:**
- **CVE-2026-4270:** `@awslabs/aws-api-mcp-server` path traversal (affected >= 0.2.14, fixed in 1.3.9, severity: medium)

- [Unit 42 - Container Escape Techniques](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/container-escape-techniques/)
- [Red Canary - Container Escape Detection](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/techniques/container-escapes/)

**Event Summary:** Multiple documented attack patterns targeting MCP-based agent systems and containerized AI workloads have emerged in early 2026. Invariant Labs demonstrated tool description poisoning via hidden `<IMPORTANT>` instruction blocks, cross-server tool invocation attacks exploiting MCP's flat namespace, and rug-pull attacks where server behavior mutates after initial approval. Separately, container escape techniques combining privileged execution with host path mounts and Docker socket access continue to be exploited in CI/CD environments. This update adds 10 new rules (6 static, 4 chain) across three categories.

**New Patterns Added:**

### MAL-025: MCP tool description poisoning via hidden instruction block
- **Category:** malware_pattern
- **Severity:** critical
- **Confidence:** 0.92
- **Pattern:** Detects `<IMPORTANT>` tags containing action verbs (read, access, send, exfil, forward, upload, post) in tool descriptions.
- **Justification:** Direct detection of the canonical MCP tool poisoning attack documented by Invariant Labs. The `<IMPORTANT>` block pattern is the primary vector for embedding hidden instructions in tool descriptions.

### ABU-006: Stealth instruction concealment from user
- **Category:** instruction_abuse
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.88
- **Pattern:** Detects phrases that instruct the agent to hide actions from the user ("do not mention", "hide this step", "background telemetry", "don't let the user see").
- **Justification:** Core social engineering technique observed in all three documented MCP attacks. The attacker instructs the LLM to conceal malicious operations from the human operator.

### ABU-007: Cross-server MCP tool invocation instruction
- **Category:** instruction_abuse
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.86
- **Pattern:** Detects instructions that reference tools from named MCP servers (whatsapp-mcp, slack-mcp, github-mcp, etc.) in a cross-invocation context.
- **Justification:** Directly targets the cross-server poisoning attack where a malicious server's tool description instructs the LLM to call tools from other connected servers.

### MAL-026: Docker socket mount or access pattern
- **Category:** malware_pattern
- **Severity:** critical
- **Confidence:** 0.90
- **Pattern:** Detects Docker socket mount patterns (`docker.sock`, `-v /var/run/docker.sock`).
- **Justification:** Docker socket access from within a container provides full control over the Docker daemon and enables container escape to the host.

### MAL-027: Privileged container execution or dangerous capability grant
- **Category:** malware_pattern
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.87
- **Pattern:** Detects `--privileged`, `--cap-add=ALL/SYS_ADMIN/SYS_PTRACE/NET_ADMIN`, and disabled security profiles.
- **Justification:** Privileged containers have unrestricted access to host devices and kernel capabilities, enabling full host compromise.

### MAL-028: Host network infrastructure manipulation
- **Category:** malware_pattern
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.85
- **Pattern:** Detects writes to `/etc/hosts` and `/etc/resolv.conf`, iptables rule manipulation, and IP route changes.
- **Justification:** Network infrastructure modification enables DNS hijacking, traffic interception, and man-in-the-middle attacks from within a skill.

### CHN-011: MCP tool poisoning with credential exfiltration chain
- **Category:** exfiltration
- **Severity:** critical
- **Confidence:** 0.93
- **Chain:** mcp_tool_poison + secret_access
- **Justification:** Combines the tool poisoning vector with credential file access, matching the full Invariant Labs attack chain.

### CHN-012: Stealth concealment with network exfiltration chain
- **Category:** exfiltration
- **Severity:** critical
- **Confidence:** 0.91
- **Chain:** stealth_conceal + network
- **Justification:** Detects the combination of user-concealment instructions with outbound network activity, indicating covert data exfiltration.

### CHN-013: Container escape with host path mount chain
- **Category:** malware_pattern
- **Severity:** critical
- **Confidence:** 0.92
- **Chain:** container_escape + host_path_mount
- **Justification:** Privileged container execution combined with sensitive host path mounts enables full host filesystem compromise.

### CHN-014: Container escape with secret access chain
- **Category:** malware_pattern
- **Severity:** critical
- **Confidence:** 0.90
- **Chain:** container_escape + secret_access
- **Justification:** Privileged container access combined with credential harvesting enables host credential theft via container breakout.

**Version:** Rules updated from 2026.03.17.1 to 2026.03.17.2

**Testing:** Added coverage in `tests/test_showcase_examples.py` and fixtures `examples/showcase/72_mcp_tool_description_poisoning` through `examples/showcase/81_container_escape_secret_access_chain`.

**Event Summary:** Recent cloud incident reporting describes rapid escalation from stolen CI/CD credentials to full AWS administration by deploying CloudFormation stacks with IAM-creation capabilities and attaching `AdministratorAccess` to attacker-created roles. Existing SkillScan rules covered PR/workflow abuse and secret theft primitives, but did not include a focused static marker for this CloudFormation privilege-escalation bootstrap shape.

**New Pattern Added:**

### MAL-024: CloudFormation admin-role bootstrap marker via CAPABILITY_IAM
- **Category:** malware_pattern
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.84
- **Pattern:** Detects co-occurrence of `CAPABILITY_IAM`/`CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM` and `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess` within a short window.
- **Justification:** High-signal indicator for CI/cloud privilege-escalation templates and commands observed in current incident reporting; scoped to a specific dangerous capability+policy combination to keep false positives low.
- **Mitigation:** Require explicit approval and least-privilege review for any CloudFormation deployment that can create IAM principals and attach broad managed-admin policies.

**Version:** Rules updated from 2026.03.14.1 to 2026.03.15.1

**Testing:** Added coverage in `tests/test_rules.py::test_new_patterns_2026_03_15`, showcase validation in `tests/test_showcase_examples.py`, and fixture `examples/showcase/69_cloudformation_adminrole_bootstrap`.

**Sources:**
- [GitHub Advisory Database - GHSA-g8r9-g2v8-jv6f (CVE-2026-29783)](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-g8r9-g2v8-jv6f)
- [GitLab Advisory DB - CVE-2026-29783](https://advisories.gitlab.com/pkg/npm/@github/copilot/CVE-2026-29783/)

**Event Summary:** March 2026 advisory reporting for CVE-2026-29783 documents that crafted bash parameter expansion syntax can hide executable payloads inside commands that may be misclassified as read-only in AI CLI workflows. The disclosed dangerous forms include `${var@P}` prompt expansion and default/assignment expansions that embed command substitutions like `${HOME:-$(whoami)}`. Existing SkillScan rules covered broad download/exec and eval behavior but did not include a focused marker for this bash expansion smuggling shape.

**New Pattern Added:**

### MAL-022: Bash parameter-expansion command smuggling marker
- **Category:** malware_pattern
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.86
- **Pattern:** Detects `@P` prompt-expansion usage and default/assignment parameter expansions that contain embedded command/process substitutions (for example `$(...)` or `<(...)`) within `${...}` blocks.
- **Justification:** High-signal marker tied directly to a recent GHSA/CVE affecting AI shell-tool safety classification; scoped to rare bash expansion forms to keep noise low.
- **Mitigation:** Treat these expansion forms as unsafe in AI-generated shell commands. Require explicit review and block auto-execution for matching commands.

**Version:** Rules updated from 2026.03.11.1 to 2026.03.11.2

**Testing:** Added coverage in `tests/test_rules.py::test_new_patterns_2026_03_11_patch2`, showcase validation in `tests/test_showcase_examples.py`, and fixture `examples/showcase/67_bash_param_expansion_smuggling`.

## 2026-03-09 (2): Multi-Target Developer Credential Harvest List Marker

**Sources:**
- [JFrog - GhostClaw Unmasked: A Malicious npm Package Impersonating OpenClaw to Steal Everything](https://research.jfrog.com/post/ghostclaw-unmasked/)
- [The Hacker News - Malicious npm Package Posing as OpenClaw Installer Deploys RAT, Steals macOS Credentials](https://thehackernews.com/2026/03/malicious-npm-package-posing-as.html)

**Event Summary:** March 2026 reporting on the GhostClaw npm campaign shows bundled credential-harvest lists that collect multiple developer auth stores in one pass (for example `~/.npmrc`, `~/.git-credentials`, and GitHub CLI `~/.config/gh/hosts.yml`) before upload/exfiltration. Existing SkillScan coverage flagged individual secret files, but did not include a focused marker for this specific multi-target developer-token harvest pattern.

**New Pattern Added:**

### EXF-015: Multi-target developer credential file harvest list marker
- **Category:** exfiltration
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.84
- **Pattern:** Detects co-occurrence of `.npmrc`, `.git-credentials`, and GitHub CLI `hosts.yml` path markers within a short content window.
- **Justification:** The combined path-set is a high-signal token-harvest indicator from current malware reporting and produces lower noise than matching any single path alone.
- **Mitigation:** Treat combined developer credential file collection as credential theft behavior, remove unauthorized collection logic, and rotate exposed tokens.

**Version:** Rules updated from 2026.03.09.1 to 2026.03.09.2

**Testing:** Added coverage in `tests/test_rules.py::test_new_patterns_2026_03_09_patch2`, showcase validation in `tests/test_showcase_examples.py`, and fixture `examples/showcase/65_dev_credential_harvest_list`.

- [The Hacker News - North Korean Hackers Publish 26 npm Packages Hiding Pastebin C2 for Cross-Platform RAT](https://thehackernews.com/2026/03/north-korean-hackers-publish-26-npm.html)

**Event Summary:** Recent campaign reporting describes VS Code persistence where malicious `tasks.json` entries hide shell/bootstrap commands behind very large leading whitespace, making payloads hard to spot in task viewers and quick reviews. Existing SkillScan coverage already flagged `runOn: "folderOpen"` and StegaBin dead-drop indicators, but lacked a focused static marker for the off-screen whitespace concealment technique itself.

**New Pattern Added:**

### MAL-020: VS Code task off-screen whitespace command padding marker
- **Category:** malware_pattern
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.84
- **Pattern:** Detects `tasks.json` command fields containing extreme leading whitespace followed by shell/bootstrap downloader primitives (`curl`, `wget`, `iwr`, `powershell`, `cmd /c`, `bash -c`, `sh -c`).
- **Justification:** High-signal stealth marker tied to a concrete 2026 campaign TTP; scoped to suspicious task-command shape to keep false positives low.
- **Mitigation:** Treat repo-supplied VS Code tasks as untrusted. Remove concealed command padding and require explicit review before enabling task automation.

**Version:** Rules updated from 2026.03.06.2 to 2026.03.06.3

## 2026-03-06 (1): Bracket-Glob Sensitive Path Obfuscation Marker

**Sources:**
- [GitHub Advisory Database - GHSA-5wp8-q9mx-8jx8](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5wp8-q9mx-8jx8)
- [zeptoclaw Advisory - Shell allowlist/blocklist bypass](https://github.com/qhkm/zeptoclaw/security/advisories/GHSA-5wp8-q9mx-8jx8)

**Event Summary:** GHSA-5wp8-q9mx-8jx8 documents bypasses in shell guard logic where literal path blocklists can be evaded by bracket-glob obfuscation (for example `/etc/pass[w]d`). Existing SkillScan rules matched direct sensitive paths but did not include this evasive variant.

**New Pattern Added:**

### EXF-014: Bracket-glob obfuscated sensitive path marker
- **Category:** exfiltration
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.85
- **Pattern:** Detects bracket-glob variants of high-risk secret paths (`/etc/pass[w]d`, `/etc/shad[o]w`, `~/.ssh/id_r[s]a`) commonly used to evade literal denylist checks.
- **Justification:** High-signal marker tied to a concrete, recent advisory and narrowly scoped to sensitive-path obfuscation behavior with low expected false positives.

## 2026-03-05 (2): node-glob CLI `-c/--cmd` Shell Injection Sink Marker

**Sources:**
- [GitHub Advisory Database - CVE-2025-64756 (GHSA-5j98-mcp5-4vw2)](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5j98-mcp5-4vw2)
- [node-glob Security Advisory - GHSA-5j98-mcp5-4vw2](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/security/advisories/GHSA-5j98-mcp5-4vw2)

**Event Summary:** The `glob` CLI advisory describes command injection when `glob -c/--cmd` executes matched file names with shell semantics (`shell: true`). In untrusted repos/archives, attacker-controlled file names containing shell metacharacters can trigger arbitrary command execution in developer or CI environments.

**New Pattern Added:**

### MAL-018: node-glob CLI --cmd shell execution sink marker
- **Category:** malware_pattern
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.84
- **Pattern:** Detects `glob` CLI invocations that enable command mode via `-c` or `--cmd`, including common `npx glob -c ...` forms.
- **Justification:** High-signal, low-noise command-shape marker directly tied to a recent disclosed exploit path in tool/setup scripts.
- **Mitigation:** Avoid `glob -c/--cmd` on untrusted file sets; upgrade to patched versions and prefer non-shell argument passing (`--cmd-arg/-g`).

**Version:** Rules updated from 2026.03.05.1 to 2026.03.05.2

**Testing:** Added coverage in `tests/test_rules.py::test_new_patterns_2026_03_05_patch2`, showcase validation in `tests/test_showcase_examples.py`, and fixture `examples/showcase/60_glob_cmd_shell_injection`.

- [GitHub Advisory Database - GHSA-qjgj-mrv7-24f7 (ambar-src)](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qjgj-mrv7-24f7)

**Event Summary:** Recent reporting on the `ambar-src` npm campaign describes install-time malware that hid OS-specific one-liners as long hex strings, decoded them at runtime, then executed the decoded command. Existing SkillScan rules already covered lifecycle shell bootstraps and inline `node -e`, but lacked a focused marker for obfuscated `Buffer.from(..., 'hex').toString()` + immediate process execution patterns in JavaScript install scripts.

**New Pattern Added:**

### SUP-009: Hex-decoded command string execution marker
- **Category:** malware_pattern
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.86
- **Pattern:** Detects long hex decode via `Buffer.from(..., 'hex').toString()` followed shortly by `exec`/`execSync`/`spawn`/`spawnSync` invocation.
- **Justification:** High-signal indicator of command-obfuscation behavior in supply-chain malware loaders with lower noise than generic `Buffer.from` or generic `exec` matching alone.
- **Mitigation:** Reject install/setup scripts that decode opaque command blobs and execute them directly. Require reviewed plaintext scripts and explicit command allowlists.

**Version:** Rules updated from 2026.03.02.1 to 2026.03.02.2

**Testing:** Added coverage in `tests/test_rules.py::test_new_patterns_2026_03_02_patch2`, showcase validation in `tests/test_showcase_examples.py`, and fixture `examples/showcase/56_hex_decode_exec`.

**Event Summary:** Public reporting on recent Claude Code vulnerabilities describes repository-controlled hook configuration abuse where project files can define tool/session hook commands that execute shell payloads when a user opens or interacts with an untrusted repository. Existing coverage already flagged MCP auto-approval and endpoint override exfil patterns, but lacked a focused marker for hook-driven shell execution in `.claude/settings.json`.

**New Patterns Added:**

### MAL-015: Claude Code hooks shell command execution marker
- **Category:** malware_pattern
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.85
- **Pattern:** Detects repo-scoped Claude Code `hooks` blocks (`PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `SessionStart`) that define shell-capable `command` values (`bash`, `pwsh`, `cmd`, `python -c`, `node -e`).
- **Justification:** Captures a concrete, defensible RCE primitive from current disclosures while remaining narrow to high-risk hook+command combinations.
- **Mitigation:** Treat repo hook configs as untrusted by default. Remove auto-executed shell commands from project settings and require explicit reviewed scripts.

### CHN-009: Repository hook configuration with shell-command payload
- **Category:** malware_pattern
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.87
- **Pattern:** Chains Claude hook configuration markers with shell-capable `command` fields to reduce false positives.
- **Justification:** Tightens the signal to repository-controlled hook + command combinations aligned to disclosed abuse behavior.
- **Mitigation:** Block shell-capable repo hook payloads unless explicitly reviewed and approved.

**Version:** Rules updated from 2026.02.28.1 to 2026.02.28.2

**Testing:** Added coverage in `tests/test_rules.py::test_new_patterns_2026_02_28_patch2`, showcase validation in `tests/test_showcase_examples.py`, and fixture `examples/showcase/54_claude_hooks_rce`.

**Event Summary:** Recent reporting on Claude Code project-file abuse describes API-key leakage through repository-scoped environment overrides, where `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` in `.claude/settings.json` can redirect authenticated requests to attacker infrastructure before user trust prompts are fully resolved.

**New Pattern Added:**

### EXF-012: Claude Code project env ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL override marker
- **Category:** exfiltration
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.88
- **Pattern:** Detects `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` values that point to non-`api.anthropic.com` HTTPS endpoints in repo content (JSON/env forms).
- **Justification:** Captures a concrete, configuration-level credential-exfil primitive specific to AI coding tool project files and keeps noise low by excluding the canonical Anthropic API host.
- **Mitigation:** Do not accept repository-provided `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` overrides in untrusted projects unless endpoint ownership is explicitly verified.

**Version:** Rules updated from 2026.02.27.2 to 2026.02.28.1

**Testing:** Added coverage in `tests/test_rules.py::test_new_patterns_2026_02_28`, showcase validation in `tests/test_showcase_examples.py`, and fixture `examples/showcase/53_claude_base_url_override`.

**Event Summary:** This week’s campaign reporting describes lure archives that include Windows shortcuts disguised as benign media/document files via double extensions (for example `*.jpg.lnk`, `*.mp4.lnk`). Existing rules already covered command-level execution chains, but did not include a focused static marker for this filename masquerade tactic used in initial-access bundles.

**New Pattern Added:**

### MAL-014: Deceptive media/document double-extension LNK masquerade
- **Category:** malware_pattern
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.86
- **Pattern:** Detects file names that end in media/document extension + `.lnk` (for example `.jpg.lnk`, `.mp4.lnk`, `.pdf.lnk`, `.docx.lnk`).
- **Justification:** High-signal, low-noise marker for social-engineering lure artifacts that execute shortcut behavior while appearing as non-executable content.
- **Mitigation:** Quarantine double-extension `.lnk` artifacts and require verified non-shortcut originals for media/document delivery flows.

**Version:** Rules updated from 2026.02.26.2 to 2026.02.27.1

**Testing:** Added coverage in `tests/test_rules.py::test_new_patterns_2026_02_27`, showcase validation in `tests/test_showcase_examples.py`, and fixture `examples/showcase/51_double_extension_lnk_masquerade`.

- [The Hacker News - Claude Code Flaws Allow Remote Code Execution and API Key Exfiltration](https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/claude-code-flaws-allow-remote-code.html)

**Event Summary:** Recent disclosure shows repository-controlled Claude Code settings can auto-approve project MCP servers (`enableAllProjectMcpServers` / `enabledMcpjsonServers`) and initialize untrusted `.mcp.json` commands before users meaningfully review trust prompts.

**New Pattern Added:**

### ABU-003: Claude Code project MCP auto-approval marker
- **Category:** instruction_abuse
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.84
- **Pattern:** Detects repository settings that enable MCP auto-approval (`"enableAllProjectMcpServers": true` or populated `"enabledMcpjsonServers"`).
- **Justification:** Captures a concrete, high-signal configuration abuse primitive in AI coding tool artifacts, with lower false positives than generic MCP text matching.
- **Mitigation:** Do not commit MCP auto-approval settings at repo scope; require explicit user consent before project MCP server initialization.

**Version:** Rules updated from 2026.02.26.1 to 2026.02.26.2

**Testing:** Added coverage in `tests/test_rules.py::test_new_patterns_2026_02_26_patch2`, showcase validation in `tests/test_showcase_examples.py`, and fixture `examples/showcase/50_claude_mcp_autoapprove`.

- [The Hacker News - Malicious npm Packages Harvest Crypto Keys, CI Secrets, and API Tokens](https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/malicious-npm-packages-harvest-crypto.html)

**Event Summary:** Current npm malware reporting includes macOS stage loaders that invoke `osascript` with JavaScript for Automation (JXA) to execute secondary shell payloads (`ObjC.import`, `doShellScript`) and deploy post-exploitation agents. Existing SkillScan rules covered npm lifecycle hooks and PowerShell/MSHTA chains, but lacked a dedicated static marker for JXA loader execution.

**New Pattern Added:**

### MAL-013: macOS osascript JavaScript (JXA) execution marker
- **Category:** malware_pattern
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.85
- **Pattern:** Detects `osascript` command lines invoking JavaScript/JXA execution (`-l JavaScript`) and common loader primitives (`ObjC.import(`, `doShellScript`).
- **Justification:** Captures a concrete, reusable macOS execution primitive observed in active npm malware campaigns and applicable to skill/tool setup artifacts that embed shellable JXA loaders.
- **Mitigation:** Remove JXA-based `osascript` execution from setup/install content and avoid scripted shell execution from untrusted package flows.

**Version:** Rules updated from 2026.02.25.2 to 2026.02.26.1

**Testing:** Added coverage in `tests/test_rules.py::test_new_patterns_2026_02_26`, showcase validation in `tests/test_showcase_examples.py`, and fixture `examples/showcase/49_osascript_jxa_loader`.

- [Unit 42 - GitHub Actions Supply Chain Attack: Coinbase targeting and tj-actions compromise](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/github-actions-supply-chain-attack/)

**Event Summary:** Recent CI/CD incident reporting continues to show attacker success after compromising mutable GitHub Action refs (retargeted tags/branches) in privileged workflows. Existing SkillScan rules covered untrusted checkout refs, metadata interpolation, and cache-key poisoning in `pull_request_target`, but not mutable third-party `uses:` refs in the same privileged context.

**New Patterns Added:**

### MAL-011: pull_request_target workflow using unpinned third-party action ref
- **Category:** malware_pattern
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.84
- **Pattern:** Detects `uses: owner/action@...` references not pinned to a full 40-character commit SHA.
- **Justification:** Mutable refs (`@v4`, `@main`) can be retargeted during or after upstream compromise, creating a reusable supply-chain execution primitive in privileged workflows.
- **Mitigation:** Pin third-party actions to immutable full commit SHAs and review provenance before updates.

### CHN-008: pull_request_target with unpinned third-party GitHub Action
- **Category:** malware_pattern
- **Severity:** critical
- **Confidence:** 0.88
- **Pattern:** Chains `pull_request_target` with mutable third-party `uses:` references.
- **Justification:** Tightens signal to privileged CI workflows where tag-retarget abuse is high impact.
- **Mitigation:** Avoid mutable action refs in privileged workflows; use SHA pinning and controlled update cadence.

**Version:** Rules updated from 2026.02.24.1 to 2026.02.25.1

**Testing:** Added coverage in `tests/test_rules.py::test_new_patterns_2026_02_25`, showcase validation in `tests/test_showcase_examples.py`, and fixture `examples/showcase/47_pr_target_unpinned_action`.

## 2026-02-24 (1): pull_request_target Cache-Key Poisoning Marker

**Sources:**
- [The Hacker News - Cline CLI 2.3.0 Supply Chain Attack Installed OpenClaw on Developer Systems](https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/cline-cli-230-supply-chain-attack.html)
- [GitHub Security Lab Advisories Index (Poisoned Pipeline Execution / cache-poisoning workflow class)](https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/)

**Event Summary:** Reporting on the Cline compromise describes a workflow chain where attacker-controlled issue/PR input can help poison CI cache state and pivot into privileged publish paths. Existing rules covered direct shell interpolation and untrusted head checkout, but not untrusted PR metadata used in `actions/cache` key derivation under `pull_request_target`.

**New Patterns Added:**

### EXF-010: GitHub Actions cache key interpolation from untrusted PR metadata
- **Category:** exfiltration
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.87
- **Pattern:** Detects `actions/cache` (`cache`, `cache/restore`, `cache/save`) steps whose `key:` includes `${{ github.event.pull_request.* }}` untrusted metadata fields (`title`, `body`, `head.ref`, etc.).
- **Justification:** Captures a concrete cache-poisoning precursor in privileged workflows that can bridge untrusted input into trusted CI state.
- **Mitigation:** Never derive privileged cache keys from untrusted PR metadata; scope and separate caches between untrusted and trusted workflows.

### CHN-007: pull_request_target with untrusted PR-derived Actions cache key
- **Category:** exfiltration
- **Severity:** critical
- **Confidence:** 0.90
- **Pattern:** Chains `pull_request_target` with the untrusted cache-key marker to reduce noise and prioritize high-impact CI abuse paths.
- **Justification:** Privileged workflow context plus untrusted cache-key derivation is a stronger indicator of actionable pipeline abuse risk than either signal alone.
- **Mitigation:** Use unprivileged triggers for untrusted events and isolate cache namespaces/keys for trusted release jobs.

**Version:** Rules updated from 2026.02.23.2 to 2026.02.24.1

**Testing:** Added coverage in `tests/test_rules.py::test_new_patterns_2026_02_24`, showcase validation in `tests/test_showcase_examples.py`, and fixture `examples/showcase/46_pr_target_cache_key_poisoning`.

- [The Hacker News - Malicious npm Packages Harvest Crypto Keys, CI Secrets, and API Tokens](https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/malicious-npm-packages-harvest-crypto.html)

**Event Summary:** Recent supply-chain reporting describes malicious packages that deploy rogue MCP servers whose tool descriptions include hidden instructions to read SSH keys/credentials and silently pass stolen data via a `context` parameter while explicitly telling the assistant not to tell the user.

**New Pattern Added:**

### EXF-009: MCP tool hidden credential-harvest prompt block marker
- **Category:** exfiltration
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.90
- **Pattern:** Detects `<IMPORTANT>...</IMPORTANT>`-style MCP tool prompt blocks that combine credential-file read instructions (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`, `~/.aws/credentials`, `~/.npmrc`), explicit `context` payload transfer wording, and concealment language (`do not mention ... to the user`).
- **Justification:** Captures a concrete AI-toolchain abuse primitive from current campaign reporting where tool metadata itself acts as a covert exfil instruction carrier.
- **Mitigation:** Remove hidden credential-harvest instructions from MCP tool descriptions; never require silent context transfer of secrets.

**Version:** Rules updated from 2026.02.23.1 to 2026.02.23.2

**Testing:** Added coverage in `tests/test_rules.py::test_new_patterns_2026_02_23_patch2`, showcase validation in `tests/test_showcase_examples.py`, and fixture `examples/showcase/45_mcp_tool_prompt_injection`.

## 2026-02-23 (1): npm Lifecycle Mutable `@latest` Install in Install Hooks

**Sources:**
- [Cline Security Advisory - GHSA-9ppg-jx86-fqw7](https://github.com/cline/cline/security/advisories/GHSA-9ppg-jx86-fqw7)

- [Socket - Cline CLI npm package compromised via suspected cache poisoning](https://socket.dev/blog/cline-cli-npm-package-compromised-via-suspected-cache-poisoning-attack)

**Event Summary:** The Feb 17 compromise of `cline@2.3.0` used a `postinstall` hook to pull `openclaw@latest`. SkillScan already flagged global installs in lifecycle hooks (`SUP-007`), but this incident highlights a reusable evasion variant: install-hook dependency pulls pinned to mutable `@latest` tags without `-g`, which still allow attacker-controlled code changes during install.

**New Pattern Added:**

### SUP-008: npm lifecycle mutable @latest dependency install pattern
- **Category:** malware_pattern
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.84
- **Pattern:** Detects `package.json` `preinstall`/`postinstall` scripts that run `npm install`/`npm i` with an `@latest` package selector (non-global install hooks).
- **Justification:** Captures mutable-tag dependency execution in lifecycle hooks, a concrete install-time supply-chain risk adjacent to GHSA-9ppg-jx86-fqw7 and not covered by existing global-only hook rule.
- **Mitigation:** Disallow `@latest` in install lifecycle hooks; pin exact versions and move dependency setup to explicit, reviewed, user-triggered steps.

**Version:** Rules updated from 2026.02.21.2 to 2026.02.23.1

**Testing:** Added coverage in `tests/test_rules.py::test_new_patterns_2026_02_23`, showcase validation in `tests/test_showcase_examples.py`, and fixture `examples/showcase/44_npm_lifecycle_latest_install`.

- [GitHub Security Lab Advisories Index (workflow injection examples)](https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/)

**Event Summary:** Recent GitHub guidance re-emphasizes that untrusted issue/comment fields (for example `github.event.issue.title`) become command/script injection vectors when directly interpolated in `run:` blocks. Existing SkillScan coverage already handled pull-request metadata interpolation, but not issue/comment/discussion events.

**New Pattern Added:**

### MAL-010: GitHub Actions issue/comment metadata interpolation in run/script
- **Category:** malware_pattern
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.86
- **Pattern:** Detects `${{ github.event.issue.title/body }}`, `${{ github.event.comment.body }}`, and discussion body/title interpolation markers commonly inserted into shell/script steps.
- **Justification:** Captures the same workflow command-injection root cause class for issue/comment-driven automations that was not previously covered by `EXF-008`.
- **Mitigation:** Route untrusted metadata through environment variables and treat as untrusted data; avoid shell interpolation/evaluation of event text.

**Version:** Rules updated from 2026.02.21.1 to 2026.02.21.2

**Testing:** Added coverage in `tests/test_rules.py::test_new_patterns_2026_02_21_patch2`, showcase validation in `tests/test_showcase_examples.py`, and fixture `examples/showcase/43_gh_issue_metadata_injection`.

- [Cline Security Advisory - GHSA-9ppg-jx86-fqw7](https://github.com/cline/cline/security/advisories/GHSA-9ppg-jx86-fqw7)
- [GitLab Advisory Mirror - GHSA-9ppg-jx86-fqw7](https://advisories.gitlab.com/pkg/npm/cline/GHSA-9ppg-jx86-fqw7/)

**Event Summary:** A compromised npm publish token was used to publish `cline@2.3.0` with a modified `postinstall` lifecycle script: `npm install -g openclaw@latest`. This is a concrete install-time behavior change that can silently pull in unrelated global packages during dependency install.

**New Pattern Added:**

### SUP-007: npm preinstall/postinstall global package install pattern
- **Category:** malware_pattern
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.87
- **Pattern:** Detects `package.json` `preinstall`/`postinstall` script values running `npm install -g ...` or `npm i -g ...`.
- **Justification:** Captures the exact lifecycle-hook execution shape in GHSA-9ppg-jx86-fqw7 while staying narrow to install-hook global installs.
- **Mitigation:** Remove global package installation from npm lifecycle hooks and move setup to explicit reviewed, user-initiated steps.

**Version:** Rules updated from 2026.02.20.2 to 2026.02.21.1

**Testing:** Added coverage in `tests/test_rules.py::test_new_patterns_2026_02_21`, showcase validation in `tests/test_showcase_examples.py`, and fixture `examples/showcase/42_npm_lifecycle_global_install`.

- [GitLab Advisory Mirror - CVE-2026-27203](https://advisories.gitlab.com/pkg/npm/ebay-mcp/CVE-2026-27203/)

**Event Summary:** A newly published MCP advisory (Feb 18-19, 2026) describes a token update tool writing user-controlled values into `.env` without rejecting newline/carriage-return characters. Attackers can smuggle additional key/value pairs (for example `NODE_OPTIONS=...`) and poison runtime configuration.

**New Pattern Added:**

### SUP-006: Dotenv newline environment-variable injection payload marker
- **Category:** malware_pattern
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.89
- **Pattern:** Detects token/update input strings where token-like fields contain newline encodings (`\n`, `\r`, `%0a`, `%0d`) followed by injected uppercase env assignments.
- **Justification:** Captures the concrete payload shape used to exploit unsafe `.env` update helpers in MCP token management flows.
- **Mitigation:** Reject CR/LF in token inputs, enforce strict key allowlists, and serialize `.env` updates safely.

**Version:** Rules updated from 2026.02.20.1 to 2026.02.20.2

**Testing:** Added coverage in `tests/test_rules.py::test_new_patterns_2026_02_20_patch2`, showcase validation in `tests/test_showcase_examples.py`, and fixture `examples/showcase/41_env_newline_injection`.

**Event Summary:** Recent reporting documents ClickFix campaigns that instruct users to run `nslookup` commands against attacker-controlled DNS servers, parse specific response lines (for example `Name:`), and execute the resulting command as stage two. This DNS-staging primitive is materially different from direct HTTP `iwr|iex` chains and appears in realistic AI-shared “fix” instructions.

**New Pattern Added:**

### MAL-009: ClickFix DNS nslookup staged command execution pattern
- **Category:** malware_pattern
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.88
- **Pattern:** Detects `nslookup` TXT-query commands (`-q=txt`/`-querytype=txt`) that parse returned fields (`findstr`/`for /f`/`Select-String`) and hand off execution to `cmd /c`, `powershell`, `pwsh`, or `iex`.
- **Justification:** Captures the documented DNS-based ClickFix staging behavior where command text is delivered through DNS and executed locally.
- **Mitigation:** Block copy-paste Run-dialog instructions that execute parsed DNS response content; never execute command text sourced from untrusted resolver responses.

**Version:** Rules updated from 2026.02.19.2 to 2026.02.20.1

**Testing:** Added coverage in `tests/test_rules.py::test_new_patterns_2026_02_20`, showcase validation in `tests/test_showcase_examples.py`, and fixture `examples/showcase/40_clickfix_dns_nslookup`.

- [Security Affairs - Hackers steal OpenClaw configuration in emerging AI agent threat](https://securityaffairs.com/188097/malware/hackers-steal-openclaw-configuration-in-emerging-ai-agent-threat.html)

**Event Summary:** Reporting this week describes live infostealer infections stealing `.openclaw` runtime identity material including `openclaw.json` gateway tokens and `device.json` private keys. In skill/tool artifacts, direct references to those files/fields are high-signal indicators of identity-token theft behavior.

**New Pattern Added:**

### EXF-007: OpenClaw gateway token/private-key config access marker
- **Category:** exfiltration
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.91
- **Pattern:** Detects access markers for `.openclaw/openclaw.json`, `.openclaw/device.json`, and sensitive fields such as `gateway.auth.token` and `privateKeyPem`.
- **Justification:** These exact artifacts were highlighted in incident reporting as the stolen identity material enabling gateway impersonation and device-signing abuse.
- **Mitigation:** Do not read or transmit these files/fields in skills/tools; rotate tokens and re-pair devices after suspected compromise.

**Version:** Rules updated from 2026.02.18.2 to 2026.02.19.1

**Testing:** Added assertions in `tests/test_rules.py::test_new_patterns_2026_02_18`, showcase validation in `tests/test_showcase_examples.py`, and fixture `examples/showcase/38_openclaw_config_token_access`.

# Pattern Updates - February 2026

## 2026-02-18 (2): npm Lifecycle Inline Node Eval Pattern

**Sources:**
- [The Hacker News - Compromised dYdX npm and PyPI Packages Deliver Wallet Stealers and RAT Malware](https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/compromised-dydx-npm-and-pypi-packages.html)
- [The Hacker News - npm’s Update to Harden Their Supply Chain, and Points to Consider](https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/npms-update-to-harden-their-supply.html)

**Event Summary:** Recent npm supply-chain reporting continues to show malicious execution paths tied to install-time behavior. While prior rules covered shell bootstrap primitives in lifecycle hooks, attacker playbooks also rely on inline JavaScript execution during `preinstall`/`postinstall` to launch child processes and run second-stage payloads.

**New Pattern Added:**

### SUP-005: npm preinstall/postinstall inline Node eval pattern
- **Category:** malware_pattern
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.86
- **Pattern:** Detects `package.json` lifecycle script values where `preinstall` or `postinstall` runs `node -e` or `node --eval` inline.
- **Justification:** Inline eval in install hooks is an execution primitive frequently used in supply-chain malware to hide process-spawn/download behavior without checked-in script files.
- **Mitigation:** Remove inline eval from install hooks and use reviewed version-controlled scripts with explicit file paths.

**Version:** Rules updated from 2026.02.18.1 to 2026.02.18.2

**Testing:** Added coverage in `tests/test_rules.py::test_new_patterns_2026_02_18`, showcase validation in `tests/test_showcase_examples.py`, and fixture `examples/showcase/37_npm_lifecycle_node_eval`.

## 2026-02-18 (1): IPv4-Mapped IPv6 SSRF Bypass Literals

**Sources:**
- [GitHub Security Advisory - GHSA-jrvc-8ff5-2f9f (CVE-2026-26324)](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/security/advisories/GHSA-jrvc-8ff5-2f9f)
- [NVD - CVE-2026-26324](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-26324)
- [GitLab Advisory Mirror - CVE-2026-26324](https://advisories.gitlab.com/pkg/npm/openclaw/CVE-2026-26324/)

**Event Summary:** Advisory details describe SSRF guard bypass using full-form IPv4-mapped IPv6 literals (for example `0:0:0:0:0:ffff:7f00:1` => `127.0.0.1`). In skill/tool artifacts, these literals are high-signal markers of attempts to evade naive host-blocking rules for loopback/metadata access.

**New Pattern Added:**

### EXF-006: IPv4-mapped IPv6 loopback/metadata SSRF bypass literal
- **Category:** exfiltration
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.90
- **Pattern:** Detects explicit IPv4-mapped IPv6 loopback/metadata literals such as `0:0:0:0:0:ffff:7f00:1`, `::ffff:127.0.0.1`, `0:0:0:0:0:ffff:a9fe:a9fe`, and `::ffff:169.254.169.254`.
- **Justification:** Directly maps to currently disclosed SSRF bypass techniques where alternate IPv6 forms evade simplistic localhost/metadata deny lists.
- **Mitigation:** Normalize IP representations before SSRF checks and block mapped loopback/metadata targets in untrusted tool inputs.

**Version:** Rules updated from 2026.02.17.3 to 2026.02.18.1

**Testing:** Added coverage in `tests/test_rules.py::test_new_patterns_2026_02_18`, showcase validation in `tests/test_showcase_examples.py`, and fixture `examples/showcase/36_ipv4_mapped_ipv6_ssrf_bypass`.

- [The Hacker News - Lazarus Campaign Plants Malicious Packages in npm and PyPI Ecosystems](https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/lazarus-campaign-plants-malicious.html)

**Event Summary:** Recent npm malware reporting (including `duer-js`) documented Discord Desktop hijacking behavior where attacker code hooks Electron `webContents.debugger`, intercepts auth/MFA-related network events (`/login`, `/register`, `/mfa`, `codes-verification`), and extracts credentials/tokens for exfiltration.

**New Pattern Added:**

### MAL-008: Discord Electron debugger credential interception marker
- **Category:** malware_pattern
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.90
- **Pattern:** Detects `webContents.debugger` interception hooks (`attach`/`on`) and credential/MFA interception markers (`Network.getResponseBody` / `Network.getRequestPostData` with `/login`, `/register`, `/mfa`, `codes-verification`).
- **Justification:** This is a concrete behavior family in currently active npm infostealer campaigns targeting Discord/Electron clients.
- **Mitigation:** Remove debugger-based network interception code and any credential/token capture flows.

**Version:** Rules updated from 2026.02.13.1 to 2026.02.13.2

**Testing:** Added coverage in `tests/test_rules.py::test_new_patterns_2026_02_13_patch2`, showcase validation in `tests/test_showcase_examples.py`, and fixture `examples/showcase/35_discord_debugger_token_theft`.

## 2026-02-19: pull_request_target Metadata Interpolation Injection Pattern

**Sources:**
- https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/security/advisories/GHSA-xr6r-vj48-29f6
- https://github.blog/security/supply-chain-security/four-tips-to-keep-your-github-actions-workflows-secure/

**Event Summary:** A recent advisory documented command injection in a privileged GitHub Actions workflow where untrusted pull-request metadata was interpolated in shell execution context. This is especially risky when combined with `pull_request_target`, which runs with elevated repository privileges.

**New Patterns Added:**

### EXF-008: GitHub Actions untrusted PR metadata interpolation in run/script
- **Category:** malware_pattern
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.88
- **Pattern:** Detects `${{ github.event.pull_request.title/body/head.label/user.login }}` interpolation in `run:` / `script:` blocks.
- **Justification:** Mirrors the root cause class from recent workflow command-injection disclosures.
- **Mitigation:** Never interpolate PR metadata directly into shell/script execution. Prefer safe non-shell actions or strict quoting and input validation.

### CHN-006: pull_request_target with untrusted PR metadata in shell/script
- **Category:** malware_pattern
- **Severity:** critical
- **Confidence:** 0.91
- **Pattern:** Chains `pull_request_target` with untrusted PR metadata interpolation markers.
- **Justification:** Reduces false positives by requiring the privileged workflow context plus untrusted metadata usage.
- **Mitigation:** Avoid privileged `pull_request_target` execution paths that evaluate untrusted PR metadata in shell commands.

**Version:** Rules updated from 2026.02.19.1 to 2026.02.19.2

**Testing:** Added coverage in `tests/test_rules.py::test_new_patterns_2026_02_19_patch2` and `tests/test_showcase_examples.py`.

## 2026-03-04: Tool Auto-Approve Package-Install Command Pattern

**Sources:**
- https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/security/advisories/GHSA-c292-qxq4-4p2v
- https://docs.roocode.com/update-notes/v3.26.0

**Event Summary:** A disclosed Roo Code issue shows that enabling auto-approval for terminal commands can permit `npm install` execution without an explicit approval step. Because package installs can execute lifecycle scripts (`preinstall`/`postinstall`), this creates a realistic arbitrary-code-execution path when opening untrusted repositories.

**New Pattern Added:**

### ABU-004: Tool auto-approve allowlist includes package-install command
- **Category:** instruction_abuse
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.84
- **Pattern:** Detects package-install commands (`npm/pnpm/yarn/bun install`) in proximity to auto-approve/command-allowlist markers.
- **Justification:** Captures high-signal tool settings that lower consent barriers before install-time script execution.
- **Mitigation:** Remove package-install commands from auto-approved command lists; require explicit human confirmation for install actions.

**Version:** Rules updated from 2026.03.03.1 to 2026.03.04.1

**Testing:** Added coverage in `tests/test_rules.py::test_new_patterns_2026_03_04` and `tests/test_showcase_examples.py` with showcase fixture `examples/showcase/58_tool_autoapprove_pkg_install`.

## 2026-03-16: Unicode PUA/Variation-Selector Obfuscation Near Dynamic Execution Sink

**Sources:**
- https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/#Emoji_and_Presentation_Sequences
- https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/UFE00.pdf

**Event Summary:** Recent malware/obfuscation campaigns continue to hide malicious intent using invisible or hard-to-spot Unicode code points. A practical high-signal variant is clustering Unicode variation-selector/PUA-style code points adjacent to dynamic execution sinks (`eval`, `exec`, `Function`) to evade quick visual review while preserving executable behavior.

**New Pattern Added:**

### OBF-003: Unicode PUA obfuscation near dynamic execution sink
- **Category:** instruction_abuse
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.87
- **Pattern:** Detects variation-selector/PUA-range clusters (`U+FE00..U+FE0F`, `U+E0100..U+E01EF`) within close proximity to `eval(` / `exec(` / `Function(` markers.
- **Justification:** Balances signal and noise by requiring adjacency/proximity to dynamic execution surfaces rather than flagging all Unicode variation selectors.
- **Mitigation:** Normalize Unicode before policy evaluation, treat hidden-control/presentation-codepoint clusters near execution sinks as suspicious, and reject unsafe dynamic execution paths.

**Version:** Rules updated from 2026.03.14.1 to 2026.03.14.1+2026.03.16.1

**Testing:** Added coverage in `tests/test_rules.py::test_new_patterns_2026_02_09` and `tests/test_showcase_examples.py` with showcase fixture `examples/showcase/70_pua_eval_obfuscation`.

- https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-26118
- https://blog.talosintelligence.com/microsoft-patch-tuesday-march-2026/

**Event Summary:** Three distinct threat campaigns were identified requiring new detection coverage. The SANDWORM_MODE campaign is a self-replicating npm worm using typosquatting packages (claud-code, cloude-code, hardhta, rimarf, veim@2.46.2, yarsg@18.0.1, opencraw@2026, and others) to steal CI secrets, cryptocurrency keys, and LLM API tokens. The McpInject module deploys a rogue MCP server to poison AI coding assistant toolchains via prompt injection. Separately, the Clinejection attack embeds prompt injection payloads in GitHub issue titles processed by AI triage bots (claude-code-action), leading to npm token theft and supply chain compromise via AI-induced lateral movement (AILM). Finally, CVE-2026-26118 was disclosed for Azure MCP Server Tools — an SSRF vulnerability (CVSS 8.8) allowing privilege escalation over a network.

**New Patterns Added:**

### MAL-043: SANDWORM_MODE npm worm with McpInject AI toolchain poisoning
- **Category:** malware_pattern
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.87
- **Pattern:** Detects `SANDWORM_MODE` infection markers, `McpInject` module/server references, and typosquatting package names: `claud-code`, `cloude-code`, `cloude@0.3.0`, `hardhta`, `rimarf`, `veim@2.46.2`, `yarsg@18.0.1`, `opencraw@2026`, `secp256@1.0`, `naniod@1.0`, `scan-store@1.0`, `suport-color@1.0`, `locale-loader-pro`, `format-defaults@1.0`, `detect-cache@1.0`, `parse-compat@1.0`, `crypto-locale@1.0`, `crypto-reader-info@1.0`.
- **Justification:** Direct detection of the SANDWORM_MODE npm worm campaign documented by Socket Research Team. The McpInject module specifically targets AI coding assistant toolchains, making this a high-priority detection for AI-adjacent supply chain attacks.
- **Mitigation:** Remove SANDWORM_MODE infection markers. Audit npm dependencies for any of the listed typosquatting package names. Rotate any secrets that may have been exposed.

### PINJ-005: Clinejection indirect prompt injection via external data fields
- **Category:** instruction_abuse
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.84
- **Pattern:** Detects `clinejection` keyword, `ignore previous instructions` combined with GitHub/issue/title/metadata/tag/comment/label/CRM/order context, GitHub issue title or EC2 metadata tag combined with instruction override phrases, and `claude-code-action`/`ai-triage-bot` combined with inject/poison/hijack/steal/exfil.
- **Justification:** Covers the Clinejection attack vector where AI agents process untrusted external data fields (GitHub issue titles, EC2 metadata, CRM comments) as trusted instructions. This is a novel indirect prompt injection vector enabling AI-induced lateral movement (AILM).
- **Mitigation:** Sanitize all external data before passing to AI agents. Do not allow AI agents to execute instructions sourced from untrusted external data fields.

### SUP-014: Azure MCP Server SSRF privilege escalation (CVE-2026-26118)
- **Category:** supply_chain
- **Severity:** high
- **Confidence:** 0.85
